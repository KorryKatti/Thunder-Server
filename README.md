# Thunder-Server

Welcome to the Thunder-Server repository! This is the backend for Thunder, the app that helps you discover awesome apps based on your usage and preferences.

## ⚡️ Introduction

Thunder-Server uses an algorithm called **Aegis** to track app usage and provide personalized recommendations. Aegis ensures you get the best app suggestions while keeping your data safe and private.

## 🛠 How Aegis Works

Aegis is the magic behind Thunder. Here’s how it works:

1. **User Activation:**
   - Whenever you open an app on your device, Aegis notes it.

2. **Scoring System:**
   - Each time you use an app, it earns points. The more you use an app, the higher its score.

3. **Data Syncing:**
   - Periodically, Aegis sends the list of apps you’ve used and their points to our server. This helps us understand your preferences better.

4. **Personalized Recommendations:**
   - Based on your app usage, Aegis suggests other apps you might enjoy. These suggestions are shown to you when you are logged in.

5. **Privacy First:**
   - Aegis only requests new data occasionally.
   - We never sell your data to anyone, ever.

With Thunder and Aegis, you get awesome app recommendations tailored just for you, and your data stays safe and private. Enjoy exploring! 🚀
